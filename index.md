## Course Description and Prerequisites

This course covers techniques in applied cryptography and their applications in machine learning and blockchain to enhance data privacy. Related cryptographic techniques include secure multiparty computations, verifiable computations and zero knowledge proofs. We will discuss their basic concepts and state-of-the-art constructions. Additionally, we will talk about how to use these techniques to construct privacy-preserving machine learning, crypto-currencies and blockchain. We will focus on efficiency and functionality constraints in practice, and discuss challenges and solutions to efficiently realize these cryptographic protocols. 

The course has no specific prerequisites. Basic knowledge of algorithms, data structures and programming is recommended.
